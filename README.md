==================

A simple example on how to structure backbone/marionette code into modules.

Thanks for taking a look at my example, file paths will need to be modified to your directory structure.

Vendor libraries such as Backbone, jquery, Underscore, Marionette, Less, Handlebars are not included, but can be configured in the main.js file which configures RequireJS.
